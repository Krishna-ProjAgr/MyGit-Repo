GIT 	- Tool used as "Version Control System"
GITHUB 	- Website

On Git we have to add and then commit, On GitHub add can be skipped and code can be directly committed

ReadMe is a special file - basic HTML will help fomartting the data in the file


git --version
pwd - Current working ID

Git Setup :
git config --global user.name "*********"
git config --global user.email "*********"
git config --list

BASIC COMMANDS :
git clone https://.... 		 - Repo's link from GitHub Website
git status 			 - checks if the code in GitHub is same as code on local machine
 
U - Untracked, M - Modified, (add)staged, unmodified

git add file_name or git add . 	 - "." will stage all components from the library 
git commit -m "********" 	 - add relatable message for changes made in place of ***

commit doesnot make changes on GitHub website, PUSh does

git push origin main		 - remote github's name is origin, main is branch name

we can check if a folder is git repo by checking if we have .git hidden file by using ls - a command

git init 			 - will make local older into git repo
git remote add origin 		 - to name the github's name 
git remote -v 			 - verify the remote to check which repo local folder is pointing to 

git branch			 - to get the branch name 
git branch -M main		 - usually the name will be Master, we can rename it to main.
